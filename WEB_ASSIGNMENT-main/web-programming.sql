It stands for Apple Chips in Data Center. The chips are likely being designed for inference—running existing AI models—as opposed to AI training. It\'s also possible Apple may never announce these new chips publicly even if they are rolled out to data centers, according to the report. PCMag has reached out to Apple for comment.\r\n\r\nWhy do more AI chips matter? As big tech firms like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Meta all develop their own energy-intensive AI models, it\'s possible demand for AI chips, supercomputers, and data centers could continue to grow. Some researchers predict that increased AI development could lead to an energy crisis as utilities firms are slow to add new power sources to the grid to get more data centers up and running.\r\n\r\nIf Apple decides to produce these chips in the US, it could also help turn the US into a leading chip manufacturer. Other firms are already getting billions in government subsidies to manufacture advanced chips in the country—like Intel, TSMC, Samsung, and Micron—as the Biden administration continues to bar high-end chip exports to China.\r\n\r\nDuring Apple\'s quarterly earnings call last week, CEO Tim Cook reiterated the tech giant\'s commitment to AI, calling it "transformative." Cook also claims that Apple has its own "advantages" when it comes to AI development.

It makes sense, then, that Microsoft is also working to shut down its last stab at an automated virtual assistant—the standalone Cortana app in Windows 10 and Windows 11 is going to stop working this month, and Microsoft is pointing users toward Bing Chat and Windows Copilot instead.\r\n\r\nSome users have reported that the Cortana app has already stopped working entirely following an app update. On a PC running a fully up-to-date version of Windows 11 22H2, my Cortana app still functions, but it told me that "Cortana in Windows is going away soon."\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has been pulling back on its support for Cortana for years, ending support for the iOS and Android versions in early 2021 and removing it from the Windows taskbar in Windows 11 a few months later. Before that, Microsoft had already removed most third-party app integrations, refocusing the assistant entirely on basic productivity tasks and Bing searches.\r\n\r\nCortana began life on Microsoft’s ill-fated Windows Phone platform in the early 2010s, where it served the same general function as Apple’s Siri and Google Now (and, later, the Google Assistant): a hands-free way to interact with your phone that also attempted to predict what you\'d need next, all filtered through a "cute" "personality."\r\n\r\nCortana came to the desktop with Windows 10 in 2015, and to Android and iOS a few months after that.

	(5, NULL, 'Linux surpasses the Mac among Steam gamers', 'Apple\'s macOS has been the second most popular operating system on the Steam game distribution platform for a long time, but that has now changed. Linux has surpassed macOS for the No. 2 spot, according to Steam\'s July user hardware survey.\r\n\r\nSteam regularly asks its users to give an anonymized look at their hardware, and the company makes the information it gathers available each month.\r\n\r\nFurther Reading\r\nLinux could be 3% of global desktops. What happened to Windows?\r\nIn July\'s survey, Windows was still reported by 96.21 percent of users\' systems, so regardless of whether Linux or macOS come in second, it\'s a decidedly distant second. Linux managed 1.96 percent, while macOS accounted for 1.84 percent of machines.\r\n\r\nThat\'s more than half a percent jump over June for Linux, and as Phoronix noted, it puts Linux close to its all-time high, which was only slightly higher many years ago when Steam had far fewer users overall.\r\n\r\nBut before you declare this a triumphant moment for desktop Linux, it\'s important to note that some of these Linux users are not, in fact, using Steam on a desktop. The Linux version "SteamOS Holo" 64-bit is the most popular reported, at just over 42 percent of the Linux slice of pie. That indicates that a huge portion of these Linux users are actually playing on Valve\'s Steam Deck portable, which runs Linux.\r\n\r\nOf course, there can be some variance in the results from month to month, depending on who opts into the survey. But that variance is usually smaller than this, given the scale at which Steam runs these surveys.\r\n\r\nThe Steam Deck was first released a while ago, but it only became widely available without a waiting list last October. We\'re likely seeing the result of a solid adoption rate since then.\r\n\r\nThere\'s another factor that could be at play on the desktop, too, though. Last month, Steam made some big changes under the hood to how the desktop application worked on Linux and macOS, some of which were built on the work done on Steam Deck. The app runs better on both platforms, though the difference was more dramatic on macOS.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Apple has been making a lot of noise about making the Mac a more viable gaming platform, given the exceptionally strong graphics performance (for integrated graphics on a laptop, at least) of the M1 and M2 series chips in the latest Macs.\r\n\r\nIt worked with game publishers to see high-profile releases like Resident Evil Village and No Man\'s Sky in recent months, and those games run pretty well on modern Macs—certainly better than similar titles on Intel-based Macs with integrated graphics chips. It also announced a new gaming porting tool in an upcoming version of macOS that works in some ways like Proton, as seen on the Steam Deck.\r\n\r\nLooking at Steam\'s numbers, though, Apple clearly has a long way to go.', 'https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Steam_Deck_case-800x450.jpg', '2023-08-12 19:45:25', '2023-08-14 03:32:40'),
	(6, NULL, 'ChromeOS is splitting the browser from the OS, getting more Linux-y', 'It looks like Google\'s long-running project to split up ChromeOS and its Chrome browser will be shipping out to the masses soon. Kevin Tofel\'s About Chromebooks has spotted flags that turn on the feature by default for ChromeOS 116 and up. 116 is currently in beta and should be live in the stable channel sometime this month.\r\n\r\nThe project is called "Lacros," which Google says stands for "Linux And ChRome OS." This will split ChromeOS\'s Linux OS from the Chrome browser, allowing Google to update each one independently. Google documentation on the project says, "On Chrome OS, the system UI (ash window manager, login screen, etc.) and the web browser are the same binary. Lacros separates this functionality into two binaries, henceforth known as ash-chrome (system UI) and lacros-chrome (web browser)." Part of the project involves sprucing up the ChromeOS OS, and Google\'s docs say, "Lacros can be imagined as \'Linux chrome with more Wayland support.\'"\r\n\r\nPreviously ChromeOS was using a homemade graphics stack called "Freon," but now with Wayland, it\'ll be on the new and normal desktop Linux graphics stack. Google\'s 2016 move to Freon was at a time when it could have moved from X11 (the old, normal desktop Linux graphics stock) directly to Wayland, but it decided to take this custom detour instead. Google says this represents "more Wayland support" because Wayland was previously used for Android and Linux apps, but now it\'ll be used for the native Chrome OS graphics, too.\r\n\r\nOn the browser side, ChromeOS would stop using the bespoke Chrome browser for ChromeOS and switch to the Chrome browser for Linux. The same browser you get on Ubuntu would now ship on ChromeOS. In the past, turning on Lacros in ChromeOS would show both Chrome browsers, the outgoing ChromeOS one and the new Linux one.\r\n\r\nLacros has been in development for around two years and can be enabled via a Chrome flag. Tofel says his 116 build no longer has that flag since it\'s the default now. Google hasn\'t officially confirmed this is happening, but so far, the code is headed that way.\r\n\r\nUsers probably won\'t notice anything, but the feature should make it easier to update Chrome OS and might even extend the lifetime of old ChromeOS devices. This should also let Google more directly roll out changes on ChromeOS. Currently, there can be a delay while Google does the extra build work for ChromeOS, so the standalone browsers get security fixes first.', 'https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/chromebook13_7-640x427.jpg', '2023-08-12 19:45:25', '2023-08-14 03:32:51'),

Hundreds of thousands of Pi boards were still being manufactured every month, but many were going to commercial buyers rather than retailers and end users.\r\n\r\nMore recently, those manufacturing numbers have climbed from 400,000 monthly units to 600,000 to 800,000 to 1 million, a level that Upton says can be sustained "for as long as is necessary to clear our remaining customer backlogs and return to free availability."\r\n\r\nWe\'re now seeing very early signs that supply is returning to normal, at least for some Pi models. UK-based Pi reseller Pimoroni announced today that it was lifting some purchase limitations on 2GB and 4GB Raspberry Pi 4 boards and Pi Zero W boards (not, apparently, the more recent Pi Zero 2 W). The rpilocator stock tracker account has also noted that its number of automated stock alerts has decreased recently "because Pis are staying in stock longer," noting that Pimoroni and The Pi Hut had (and still have) multiple Pi 4 variants in stock.\r\n\r\nEven as stock returns to normal, we\'ll still be dealing with the aftereffects of the shortage for some time to come; the "temporary" price increase for the 2GB Pi 4 board still hasn\'t been reverted, and Upton\'s past comments have implied that the company has put off the development of the Pi 5 to allow stock of current models to return to normal (the Pi 4 was introduced just over four years ago). Other retailers still have purchasing restrictions in place. And some models and retailers will clearly recover more quickly than others.\r\n\r\nAs hobbyists wait for Pi supplies to return to normal, they\'ve turned to all kinds of other hardware to do the same kinds of work. Discarded corporate thin client PCs and old phones can both handle some of the lightweight tasks at which Pis commonly excel.\r\n\r\nBut those alternate devices don\'t work with the hardware and software projects made specifically for the Pi, including everything from NES-style retro-themed game console cases to Game Boy and BlackBerry-themed portable enclosures.', 'https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/pi_factory.jpg', '2023-08-12 19:45:25', '2023-08-14 03:33:14'),

The new kind of drive technology uses lasers to heat disk platters during writing, making it possible to store more data on a disk without increasing its physical size.\r\n\r\nBut there\'s still a bit more capacity to be wrung out of older and more-proven recording technologies like perpendicular (or conventional) magnetic recording (PMR/CMR, often used interchangeably) and shingled magnetic recording (SMR); Western Digital announced this week that it\'s preparing to sample huge 28TB hard drives based on those technologies, a little over a year after announcing its first 26TB model.\r\n\r\nAccording to Tom\'s Hardware, WD uses energy-assisted perpendicular magnetic recording (ePMR) to fit up to 24TB of data on a single drive. SMR allows magnetic tracks to overlap slightly (like the shingles on a roof), allowing slightly more data to fit onto the same physical platters at the expense of write performance—this boosts the capacity of these drives to 28TB.\r\n\r\nDuring its most recent earnings call, Western Digital CEO David Goeckeler reiterated that 28TB wasn\'t the end for its ePMR and SMR-based hard drives. Past roadmaps have indicated that 30TB and 32TB SMR drives should also be possible, though these drives aren\'t ready for sampling to Western Digital\'s customers yet.\r\n\r\nWestern Digital is working on HAMR-capable drives, too, but the company doesn\'t think they\'ll be available in volume until late 2025 at the earliest. Seagate expects to ship its first 32TB HAMR drives before then, and the company has already talked about HAMR drives as large as 50TB being tested in its labs.\r\n\r\nWestern Digital\'s earnings are buffeted by some of the same forces affecting other PC hardware and software companies like Intel and Microsoft. The company\'s earnings for Q4 2023 were down 5 percent year over year, mostly driven by an 18 percent drop in revenue for its cloud business.

It\'s small, but it\'s something.\r\n\r\nDirect from Microsoft, you can now buy a half-dozen Xbox repair and replacement parts for both the Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 and the standard Xbox Wireless Controller. Each controller has top cases and button replacement sets in black and white, plus the two inner circuit boards that provide charging, input, vibration, and, of course, sockets with new potentiometers installed to fix stick drift.\r\n\r\nParts on their own aren\'t that helpful to most of us, though, so Microsoft is also providing written and video guides. The videos are essentially full teardowns of each controller. The Elite Series 2 requires a plastic pry tool (aka spudger), a T6 and T8 screwdriver, and tweezers. The videos are helpful and aimed at all skill levels.

	(12, NULL, 'The Google Assistant is getting a big reboot around generative AI', 'Axios has more details about Google\'s plan to reboot the Google Assistant into something based around generative AI. As was previously reported, the Google Assistant team is getting reorganized around Google\'s new LLM (large language model) ChatGPT-clone, Google Bard. Axios was given a copy of an email to employees explaining their new marching orders and says that "dozens" of people are being laid off out of the "thousands" that work on the Google Assistant.\r\n\r\nThe email, written by Google VP Peeyush Ranjan and Director of Product Duke Dukellis, tells the team to "explore what a supercharged Assistant, powered by the latest LLM technology, would look like." The two execs say they\'ve "heard people\'s strong desire for assistive, conversational technology that can improve their lives."\r\n\r\nIt\'s hard to make heads or tails of Google\'s jargon-filled internal communications, but it sounds like a lot of changes are happening. Whatever the "Services and Surface teams" are in the Google Assistant are being merged, while the mobile team will now "operate separately" from that group (it sounds like this is all client app work?). The "NLP" (we\'re assuming that\'s "Natural Language Processing") team is getting new leadership, while a "Speech" team "will continue supporting Assistant and other products."\r\n\r\nFor now, the email says: "We remain deeply committed to Assistant and we are optimistic about its bright future ahead." "Deeply committed" is usually not where you want to be in Google doublespeak land. Google Stadia VP Phil Harrison said Google was "deeply committed to gaming" after shutting down Stadia and then he left the company a few months later. Google AI lead Jeff Deen said the company was "deeply committed" to AI Ethics after firing researcher Timnit Gebru, and today members of the ethics team say they were shut out of high-priority launches like Google Bard. Google PR just recently said the company was "deeply committed to Waze’s unique brand" on the same day it stripped the division of independent company status and merged it with Google Maps.\r\n\r\nGoogle Assistant\'s version of "deeply committed" has so far involved stopping all hardware releases, with the last Assistant device launching 2.5 years ago in March 2021. The Pixel Tablet sure looks like it started life as a Google Assistant smart display, thanks to it looking identical to a Nest Hub, but never actually made it to market as a new device in that lineup. The Fuchsia OS team had been taking over Google Assistant smart display software, but 9to5Google reports that work on doing the same for speakers has stopped. Google also reportedly told employees it will "invest less" in the Google Assistant on third-party devices, including cars. Whatever the Google Assistant pivot ends up being, it looks like a big pivot.\r\n\r\nWhat does the “Google Assistant” mean to you?\r\n\r\nIt\'s unclear exactly how a language model would help a voice assistant. A language model is for generating large blocks of text, while a voice assistant is about listening to voice commands, understanding them, and then performing some kind of action. The primary complaint about the Google Assistant is that voice recognition seemingly gets worse with every passing day, with replies taking longer and exhibiting more bugs, as core features like voice authentication and multi-user support quietly disappear. A language model is about text, and mixing up ChatGPT and a voice assistant wouldn\'t help one bit with the core voice-to-text input. The Assistant is actually fine when it comes to processing correctly recognized voice commands; it\'s just a question of getting the voice part right.\r\n\r\nI\'m sure everyone uses a voice assistant differently, but I generally ask it to do something, and I want that task done quickly and quietly—turn off the lights, set a timer, remind me to do something, add a thing to my shipping list, that sort of thing. In the rare case I ask it an open-ended "Google Search" question, the short infobox responses are great. The idea of a voice assistant that replies by reading paragraphs and paragraphs of generated text in the usual stilted robot voice sounds annoying. The idea of this being a long, "conversational" interaction is definitely not how I\'ve used the Assistant in the past. Theoretically, a language model could help with parsing the intent of strangely worded commands, but today that\'s not a real problem with most voice assistants. If you plainly say what you want, they can understand and perform the task pretty well.\r\n\r\nI think the core problem here is that Google Assistant doesn\'t make any money, so something has to change. The hardware is sold at cost, and with no ads or subscriptions, the Assistant generates no revenue, while the cloud processing costs just keep piling up. Google and Amazon\'s Alexa started this voice assistant war and are now in the same boat: products that were loss leaders years ago never discovered a revenue path and have run out of runway. Seven-ish years ago, both products were created when voice assistants were the hot new thing, and now that AI language models are the hot new thing, pivoting buys them more time as loss leaders to hope to someday find a revenue stream.\r\n\r\nThat\'s actually still the billion-dollar question: How will a voice assistant make money? How does adding a language model help it make money? It might help that one of the authors of the letter, Dukellis, only joined the Assistant team in November 2022 and, before that, spent six years as the director of product management for Google\'s publisher-facing ad products.', 'https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/hey-google-800x532.jpg', '2023-08-14 03:37:36', '2023-08-14 03:37:36'),

Based on the joint specification developed by Google and Apple, and incorporating feedback from tracker-makers like Tile and Chipolo, the alerts currently work only with AirTags, but Google says it will work with tag manufacturers to expand its coverage.\r\n\r\nFor now, if an AirTag you don\'t own "is separated from its owner and determined to be traveling with you," a notification will tell you this and that "the owner of the tracker can see its location." Tapping the notification brings up a map tracing back to where it was first seen traveling with you. Google notes that this location data "is always encrypted and never shared with Google."\r\n\r\nAn example of the kind of alert an Android user will get soon, telling them if an AirTag or other tracker has been following them.\r\n\r\nFurther into the prompts, you can make the tracker play a sound, "without the owner of the tracker knowing," Google says. If you bring the tracker to the back of your phone (presumably within NFC range), some trackers may provide their serial number and information about their owner, "like the last four digits of their phone number." Google indicates it will also link to information about how to physically disable a tracker.\r\n\r\nFinally, Google offers a manual scan feature if you\'re suspicious that your Android phone isn\'t catching a tracker or want to see what\'s nearby. The alerts are rolling out through a Google Play services update to devices on Android 6.0 and above over the coming weeks.\r\n\r\nHow does this relate to Google\'s planned expansion of its Find My Device network, which would allow everyone holding the world\'s most popular smartphone OS to take part in global scavenger hunts for trackers? Google is glad you asked. Because user safety and tracking prevention are "a top priority for Android," Google is working to finish the joint tracking specification "by the end of this year."\r\n\r\nAnd so: "At this time, we\'ve made the decision to hold the rollout of the Find My Device network until Apple has implemented protections for iOS."\r\n\r\nAs noted previously, while both iPhones and Android phones offer gigantic economies of scale for someone wandering within Bluetooth range of your device, you\'ll have to pick which side of the duopoly to pin your hopes on. While Apple and Google work together on avoiding malicious use of their tracking networks—which involves knowing what each other\'s tracker signals look like—their devices won\'t be able to work across the OS divide. That leaves companies like Chipolo and Tile having to make different versions of each device for the two companies\' networks.', 'https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/android_tracking_alerts_top-800x333.jpg', '2023-08-14 03:37:36', '2023-08-14 03:37:36'),
	(15, NULL, 'IBM Open-Sources Granite AI Models, Launches InstructLab Platform', 'IBM and software subsidiary Red Hat have created a new open-source platform for AI development called InstructLab, the company announced Tuesday. The new platform is designed to allow anyone to contribute to large language models (LLMs) and increase access to existing models, according to a statement.\r\n\r\nIBM has open-sourced some of its Granite AI models, including its Granite 7B model, for InstructLab users. Red Hat is also launching an Enterprise Linux AI platform (RHEL AI), which also uses open-sourced Granite models and InstructLab tech.\r\n\r\nRed Hat SVP and Chief Product Officer Ashesh Badani says in a statement that both InstructLab and RHEL AI will help "lower many of the barriers facing GenAI across the hybrid cloud, from limited data science skills to the sheer resources required."\r\n\r\nTruly open-source AI tools aren\'t too common among the biggest AI firms. Google\'s Gemini is a closed, proprietary model, as is Microsoft\'s Copilot, which was built with some open-source tech. Microsoft-backed OpenAI has also kept ChatGPT closed off to the public, despite what its name might suggest. And some so-called "open-source" AI models aren\'t as open and available as their creators claim, like Meta\'s Llama 2 model.', 'https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/articles/07myCppVj3q3BcvT3CrXw8S-1.fit_lim.size_1600x900.v1715089857.jpg', '2024-05-07 14:30:32', '2024-05-07 14:30:42');
